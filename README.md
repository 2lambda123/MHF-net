    CMHF-net\    : Code of Consistent MS/HS Fusion Net
    BMHF-net\    : Code of Blind MS/HS Fusion Net

Consistent MHF-net and Blind MHF-net. The former is suitable in the case that spectral and spatial responses of training and testing data are consistent, just as considered in most of the pervious general supervised MS/HS fusion researches. The latter ensures a good generalization in mismatch cases of spectral and spatial responses in training and testing data, and even across different sensors, which is generally considered to be a challenging issue for general supervised MS/HS fusion methods.
