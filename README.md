# MHF-net
Code of Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion by MS/HS Fusion Net

I am adding in Blind MHF-net. This version of MHF-net ensures a good generalization in mismatch cases of spectral and spatial responses in training and testing data, and even across different sensors, which is generally considered to be a challenging issue for general supervised MS/HS fusion
methods.

The code of CVPR papaer "Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion by MS/HS Fusion Net" is in Subfolder CMHF-net (Consistent MHF-net, suitable in the case that spectral and
spatial responses of training and testing data are consistent, just as considered in most of the pervious general supervised MS/HS fusion researches)
